	abstract = {Semantic-enhanced recommendation systems are promising approaches to overcome the sparsity and cold-start problems, which are hard to handle using the conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Further research is needed to effectively integrate ontologies into collaborative filtering recommender systems. This paper proposes an ontology-based semantic similarity measure to evaluate similarities between items and eventually generate accurate recommendations. The proposed semantic similarity measure termed fusion-based semantic similarity takes into account the semantics of ontological instances (i.e. items) inferred from a specific domain ontology, which is determined by analyzing the hierarchical relationships among the instances, as well as the features of the instances and their relationships to other instances. The new measure comprehensively captures the semantic knowledge associated with instances by exploiting all possible shared semantics between instances in a given domain ontology. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new semantic-enhanced hybrid recommendation approach as a result of combining the new semantic similarity measure with the standard item-based CF to enhance the quality of generated recommendations. In order to assess the effectiveness of our semantic-enhanced hybrid collaborative filtering method, a series of experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach against well-established benchmark techniques. The reported experimental results consistently emphasize its superiority, demonstrating enhanced predictive abilities and a notable improvement in the quality of recommendations. More specifically, the proposed approach achieved notable 6\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in certain cases, outperforming other benchmark techniques. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of using semantic-based similarity to enhance the performance of recommendation systems. Such enhancements address challenges within collaborative filtering, potentially leading to advancements in recommendation system design and optimization. © The Author(s) 2024.},

It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Matrix factorization is a long-established method employed for analyzing and extracting valuable insight recommendations from complex networks containing user ratings. The execution time and computational resources demanded by these algorithms pose limitations when confronted with large datasets. Community detection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying groups and communities within intricate networks. To overcome the challenge of extensive computing resources with matrix factorization techniques, we present a novel framework that utilizes the inherent community information of the rating network. Our proposed approach, named Community-Based Matrix Factorization (CBMF), has the following steps: (1) Model the rating network as a complex bipartite network. (2) Divide the network into communities. (3) Extract the rating matrices pertaining only to those communities and apply MF on these matrices in parallel. (4) Merge the predicted rating matrices belonging to communities and evaluate the root mean square error (RMSE). In our experimentation, we use basic MF, SVD++, and FANMF for matrix factorization, and the Louvain algorithm is used for community division. The experimental evaluation on six datasets shows that the proposed CBMF enhances the quality of recommendations in each case. In the MovieLens 100K dataset, RMSE has been reduced to 0.21 from 1.26 using SVD++ by dividing the network into 25 communities. A similar reduction in RMSE is observed for the datasets of FilmTrust, Jester, Wikilens, Good Books, and Cell Phone. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As time passes, the data within information systems may continuously evolve, causing the target concept to drift. To ensure the effectiveness of data-driven decision making, it is crucial to detect drift in a timely manner and gather relevant information. In this paper, we introduce two methods that can directly detect concept drift in the provided information system, by considering a new perspective on uncertainty. First, using entropy under a single attribute constraint, we define the uncertainty of the target concept in an information system. By integrating the uncertainty of each attribute, the overall uncertainty of the target concept in the information system is obtained. Subsequently, two concept drift detection methods are proposed, namely EBTBM (Entropy-Based Threshold-Based Method) and EBSBM (Entropy-Based Sampling-Based Method). These methods utilize the defined uncertainty of the target concept as a statistical measure of the difference between two data blocks. Finally, extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data sets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed concept drift detection methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To comprehend the genuine reading habits and preferences of diverse user cohorts and furnish tailored reading recommendations, this study introduces an English text reading recommendation model designed specifically for long-tail users. This model integrates collaborative filtering algorithms with the FastText classification method. Initially, the integrated collaborative filtering algorithm is explicated, followed by the calculation of the user's interest distribution across various types of English texts, achieved through an enhanced Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and analysis of user reading behaviors. Subsequently, an intelligent English text reading recommendation is generated by amalgamating collaborative filtering algorithms with association rule-based recommendation algorithms. Through optimization of the recommendation generation process, the model's recommendation accuracy is enhanced, thereby augmenting the performance and user satisfaction of the recommendation system. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted with respect to the Top-N algorithm model, matrix factorization-based algorithm model, and FastText classification model, illustrating the superior recommendation accuracy and F-Measure value of the proposed model. The study findings indicate that when the recommendation list contains 10, 30, 50, and 70 texts, the recommendation accuracy of the proposed algorithm model is 0.75, 0.79, 0.8, and 0.74, respectively, outperforming other algorithms. Furthermore, as the number of texts increases, the F-Measure of all four models gradually improves, with the final F-Measure of the proposed model reaching 0.81. Notably, the F-Measure of the English text reading recommendation model proposed in this study significantly surpasses that of the other three recommendation methods. Demonstrating commendable performance in recall rate, root mean square error, normalized cumulative gain, precision, and accuracy, the model adeptly reflects user reading interests, thereby enhancing the accuracy of text recommendations and the overall system performance. The study findings offer crucial insights and guidance for enhancing the accuracy and overall efficacy of English text recommendation systems. © 2024 The Author},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have the effect of guiding users in a personalized way to interesting objects in a large space of possible options. Content-based recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recommender consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to recommend to the user new interesting items. This chapter provides an overview of content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation. The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of contentbased recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages and drawbacks. The second part of the chapter provides a review of the state of the art of systems adopted in several application domains, by thoroughly describing both classical and advanced techniques for representing items and user profiles. The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered.},

Nevertheless, the large amount and the speed with which information appears makes the task of research and analysis too difficult for a person in need of information. Recommender systems are therefore proposed as a solution. Recommender systems allow to filter information according to the relevance or the preference of the user. They are often used to make suggestions in e-commerce or for entertainment (movies, music, games, etc.) but are less known for finding scientific information. The purpose of this paper is then to summarize the few important academic works that address the problematic of recommending scientific papers. In this paper, we review recommendation algorithms and methods, such as Content-Based methods, Collaborative Filtering methods and Hybrid methods. We will then walk through different important approaches that researches have come up to recommend scientific papers.

Accordingly, a big effort is now spent to investigate to what extent such information can be exploited to develop new knowledge-based services or to improve the effectiveness of knowledge-intensive platforms as Recommender Systems (RS). To this end, in this article we study the impact of the exogenous knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation framework. Specifically, we propose a methodology to automatically feed a graph-based RS with features gathered from the LOD cloud and we analyze the impact of several widespread feature selection techniques in such recommendation settings. The experimental evaluation, performed on three state-of-the-art datasets, provided several outcomes: first, information extracted from the LOD cloud can significantly improve the performance of a graph-based RS. Next, experiments showed a clear correlation between the choice of the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize specific evaluation metrics, as accuracy or diversity of the recommendations. Moreover, our graph-based algorithm fed with LOD-based features was able to overcome several baselines, as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems can greatly enhance the exploitation of large digital libraries, however, in order to achieve good accuracy with collaborative recommenders some domain assumptions must be met, such as having a large number of users sharing similar interests over time. Such assumptions may not hold in digital libraries, where users are structured in relatively small groups of experts whose interests may change in unpredictable ways: this is the case of scientific and technical documents archives. Moreover, when recommending documents, users often expect insights on the recommended content as well as a detailed explanation of why the system has selected it, which cannot be provided by collaborative techniques. In this paper we consider the domain of scientific publications repositories and propose a content-based recommender based upon a graph representation of concepts built up by linked keyphrases. This recommender is coupled with a keyphrase extraction system able to generate meaningful metadata for the documents, which are the basis for providing helpful and explainable recommendations. 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality. © 2017 ACM.},

Often, the user's initial interest can be uniquely linked to an entity in a knowledge base. In this case, it is natural to recommend the explicitly linked entities for further exploration. In real world knowledge bases, however, the number of linked entities may be very large and not all related entities may be equally relevant. Thus, there is a need for ranking related entities. In this paper, we describe Spark, a recommendation engine that links a user's initial query to an entity within a knowledge base and provides a ranking of the related entities. Spark extracts several signals from a variety of data sources, including Yahoo! Web Search, Twitter, and Flickr, using a large cluster of computers running Hadoop. These signals are combined with a machine learned ranking model in order to produce a final recommendation of entities to user queries. This system is currently powering Yahoo! Web Search result pages. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Incorporating a knowledge graph (KG) into recommender systems has been widely studied by researchers. Existing methods mostly extract the paths connecting user-item pairs and model these paths or iteratively propagate the user preference over the KG. These methods can capture the semantics of entities and relations well and help to comprehend users’ interests. However, these methods ignore the implicit features between the KG’s external items and thus cannot fully capture the users’ preferences. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model named E nhanced K nowledge-aware P ath N etwork (EKPN) to exploit the KG and capture implicit features between items outside the KG for recommendation. EKPN consists of two neural network modules: one module captures explicit features between items in the knowledge graph by automatically generating paths from users to candidate items for recommendation; the other module explores implicit features between items outside the knowledge graph by utilizing users’ historical interactions. To better capture the implicit features between items outside the knowledge graph, we propose the activation gate mechanism. Finally, we use a fusion mechanism to combine the two modules to enhance each other and achieve higher performance. Extensive validation on two real-world datasets shows the superiority of EKPN over baselines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Intelligent data handling techniques are beneficial for users; to store, process, analyze and access the vast amount of information produced by electronic and automated devices. The leading approach is to use recommender systems (RS) to extract relevant information from the vast amount of knowledge. However, early recommender systems emerged without the cognizance to contextualize information regarding users' recommendations. Considering the historical methodological limitations, Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) are now deployed, which leverage contextual information in addition to the classical two-dimensional search processes, providing better-personalized user recommendations. This paper presents a review of recent developmental processes as a fountainhead for the research of a context-aware recommender system. This work contributes by taking an integrated approach to the complete CARS developmental process, unlike other review papers, which only address a specific aspect of the CARS process. First, an in-depth review is presented pertaining to the state-of-the-art and classified literature, considering the domain of the application models, filters, extraction and evaluation approaches. Second, viewpoints are presented relating to the extraction of literature with analysis on the merit and demerit of each, and the evolving processes between them.

In this setting, the adoption of semantics-aware representations can be very useful to build a more precise representation of users and items, and, in turn, to generate better recommendations. To this end, this chapter presents a comprehensive survey of the recent trends in the area of semantics-aware content-based recommender systems. The discussion starts with an overview of historical developments, then it covers methods for semantic representations, by splitting the approaches into exogenous and endogenous representation techniques. The former rely on the integration of external knowledge sources, while the latter are based on the hypothesis that the meaning of words depends on their usage in large corpora of textual documents. Next, we discuss recent trends in the area of semantics-aware recommendations. Such trends regard novel representation methods, based on knowledge graphs and embedding techniques, as well as the exploitation of user-generated content (tags, reviews, etc.) and multimedia features. Finally, we conclude our overview by showing how content can be used to support the construction of natural language explanations and to build conversational recommender systems. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2011, 2015, 2022.},

By exploring the interlinks within a knowledge graph, the connectivity between users and items can be discovered as paths, which provide rich and complementary information to user-item interactions. Such connectivity not only reveals the semantics of entities and relations, but also helps to comprehend a user’s interest. However, existing efforts have not fully explored this connectivity to infer user preferences, especially in terms of modeling the sequential dependencies within and holistic semantics of a path.In this paper, we contribute a new model named Knowledgeaware Path Recurrent Network (KPRN) to exploit knowledge graph for recommendation. KPRN can generate path representations by composing the semantics of both entities and relations. By leveraging the sequential dependencies within a path, we allow effective reasoning on paths to infer the underlying rationale of a user-item interaction. Furthermore, we design a new weighted pooling operation to discriminate the strengths of different paths in connecting a user with an item, endowing our model with a certain level of explainability. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets about movie and music, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art solutions Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding and Neural Factorization Machine.},

In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.},

Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.},

Even though the recent recommender systems are eminent in giving precise recommendations, they suffer from various limitations and challenges like scalability, cold-start, sparsity, etc. Due to the existence of various techniques, the selection of techniques becomes a complex work while building application-focused recommender systems. In addition, each technique comes with its own set of features, advantages and disadvantages which raises even more questions, which should be addressed. This paper aims to undergo a systematic review on various recent contributions in the domain of recommender systems, focusing on diverse applications like books, movies, products, etc. Initially, the various applications of each recommender system are analysed. Then, the algorithmic analysis on various recommender systems is performed and a taxonomy is framed that accounts for various components required for developing an effective recommender system. In addition, the datasets gathered, simulation platform, and performance metrics focused on each contribution are evaluated and noted. Finally, this review provides a much-needed overview of the current state of research in this field and points out the existing gaps and challenges to help posterity in developing an efficient recommender system. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendater system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommender systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2011, 2015, 2022.},

	abstract = {This book comprehensively covers the topic of recommender systems, which provide personalized recommendations of products or services to users based on their previous searches or purchases. Recommender system methods have been adapted to diverse applications including query log mining, social networking, news recommendations, and computational advertising. This book synthesizes both fundamental and advanced topics of a research area that has now reached maturity.  The chapters of this book  are organized into three categories: - Algorithms and evaluation:  These chapters discuss the fundamental algorithms in recommender systems, including collaborative filtering methods, content-based methods, knowledge-based methods, ensemble-based methods, and evaluation. - Recommendations in specific domains and contexts: the context of a recommendation can be viewed as important side information that affects the recommendation goals. Different types of context such as temporal data, spatial data, social data, tagging data, and trustworthiness are explored. - Advanced topics and applications:  Various robustness aspects of recommender systems, such as shilling systems, attack models, and their defenses are discussed. In addition, recent topics, such as learning to rank, multi-armed bandits, group systems, multi-criteria systems, and active learning systems, are introduced together with applications. Although this book primarily serves as a textbook, it will also appeal to industrial practitioners and researchers due to its focus on applications and references. Numerous examples and exercises have been provided, and a solution manual is available for instructors. About the Author: Charu C.
